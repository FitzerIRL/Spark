# Spark (aka pxscene)

Spark is an application runtime built from the pxCore repository [here](https://github.com/pxscene/pxCore/blob/master/README.md).

This Spark repository is the home for Spark documentation and examples.  Note that examples here are still under construction. In the meantime, you can find them in the pxscene github repository [here](https://github.com/pxscene/pxscene/tree/gh-pages) . They are published via github pages to http://www.pxscene.org/ (Not IPv6 Compatible).
