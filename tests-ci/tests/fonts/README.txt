RE:    test_fallbackFont.js

NOTE:  "FreeSansMissingA_only.ttf" is a duplicate of "FreeSansMissingA.ttf"

      The two seperate (but identical) files above are needed so as to create 2 fontResources withing Spark.

      "FreeSansMissingA.ttf" ==  "FreeSansMissingA_only.ttf" == ("FreeSans.ttf" with "A" glyph removed)
